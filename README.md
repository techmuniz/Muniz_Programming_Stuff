Just a little tool I created to save myself from doing a thousand clicks per day.


Known Bugs:

Some functions only work when browser zoom is 100% /n
Rarely (1 out of 50, probably) program saves the "Similar Profiles" in the side, instead of the current candidate in the screeen
If you try to insert more than one letter as a key, it will break the program 
Program will probably break if you do something that you should not do it :D
